Besides **arbiter** and **bartender** in *Quindecim* works **assistent** ***Quin*** ‚Äì she prepares **guests**' life description ( as known as prehistory ) prior to their death and hand information over to the **arbiter** before **guests** arrive at the bar; each **guest** has `id`, `name`, `the cause of death` and in addition their `date of birth`.

After **guests** arrive at the bar, **arbiter** offers to play a game for them, **guests**, not realizing that they have already died, agree in the hope of getting out of the strange place as soon as possible. One of the **guests** presses the button in the table and randomly one game for two falls out. **Guests** enter prepared room and begin to play. During game people's darkest sides, what were previously deep inside, come out. After game regardless of who won and who lost ( the game itself is needed only to bring people to their true selves ) **arbiter** gives verdict based on the **guests**' prehistories and their behavior during the game.

*Quindecim* offers different sorts of drinks and snacks. At the bar desk are both non-alcoholic drink and alcoholic beverages, each type has many various kinds.

### Loop discussion üîÅ


1. **Workers** are allowed to drink and eat at the workplace. In this regard, **the bartender**, in addition to serving **guests**, is also engaged in serving **workers**. **The bartender** can also order and serve herself.

2. **Arbiter** is **a worker** who also happens to be **the owner of the bar**. As such, he performs two duties: he acts as **the arbiter** and **the owner**. His position as **the owner** allows him to have a personal connection with the bar because he owns it. The rest of **the workers** are **not owners**; they only work in the bar.

3. After a game, **Arbiter** gives a verdict to **the guests**. Once a verdict has been given, **the guests** are no longer able to make orders.

4. **A guest**, for whom **the assistant** has prepared a prehistory, can make orders. There cannot be a case where **the guest** does not have a prehistory.
